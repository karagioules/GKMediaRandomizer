## Features

### Media Playback
- **Randomized playback**: Shuffles images and videos with double-pass OS-entropy seeding.
- **Recursive scanning**: Finds supported media inside the selected folder and its subfolders.
- **Wide format support**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM, M4V, 3GP, and more.
- **Aspect-fit images**: Displays photos and artwork cleanly without cropping.
- **Looping video playback**: Uses VLC on Windows for reliable local video playback.

### Workflow
- **Keyboard navigation**: Use right arrow, left arrow, and spacebar for fast browsing.
- **Recoverable deletion**: Delete moves the current file to the Recycle Bin.
- **Session memory**: Remembers the last selected folder between launches.
- **Simple Windows installer**: Inno Setup installer creates desktop and Start Menu shortcuts.

### Updates
- Checks this repository's GitHub Releases for new Windows installer builds.
- Supports ETag caching to reduce GitHub API usage.
- Verifies installer SHA256 hashes when release notes include `SHA256: <64-char hex>`.
- Tracks skipped versions so dismissed automatic prompts stay quiet.
- Detects failed installs on the next launch and warns the user.

## Building

```bash
cd Windows
pip install PySide6 python-vlc send2trash
